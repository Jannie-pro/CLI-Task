Open Circuit: An open circuit in one of the three phases causes the heating of the transformer. Compared to other faults open circuits are harmless, during such faults transformers can be manually disconnected from the system.
• Over-Fluxing: Over fluxing can be caused by poor regulation of voltage and frequency on the power system. The flux density in the transformer core is proportional to the ratio of voltage to frequency. Transformers work with a value of flux density in the core. If full excitation is applied in a generator transformer before it reaches its synchronous speed then over fluxing of the core could occur due to high V/f.
• Earth Faults: The flow of earth fault current is dependent on their being a presence of a zero-sequence path. The ampere turn balance between the secondary and primary windings must be maintained. The magnitude of the transformer earth fault current is depended on the method of earthing, the impedance of winding, the transformer connection and position of the fault on the winding. Solidly earthed transformer has their winding impedance to limit the earth fault current. Earth faults are the most common type of faults in the transformer, to reduce the earth’s fault additional impedance can be added to the zero-sequence current paths by using earthing transformers and resistors.
• Phase Faults: Phase to phase faults or three-phase faults do not flow through the earthing arrangement and therefore are limited by winding impedance only. The value of winding impedance is deliberately designed into the transformer in order to limit the maximum short circuit current. It is achieved by designing the leakage reactance flux which does not link the primary and secondary windings to give the desired short-circuit level. To remove these faults Buchholz surge and differential relays can be used.
• Inter Turn Faults: These faults occur in the high voltage winding because of the degradation of the insulation and it could be caused by the voltage doubling at the HV terminal. The voltage doubling can be caused by lightning or switching. The inter-turn faults cause localized extreme hot spots to occur as the faulted turns carry huge currents and this would badly affect the winding insulation. These faults can be detected by using the Buchholz gas device and differential relay.
